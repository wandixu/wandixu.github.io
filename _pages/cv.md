Education
======
* Ph.D in Chemistry, Johns Hopkins, 2027 (expected)
* B.S. in Chemistry, University of Minneasota, Twin Cities, 2020


Research Experience
======
* **Research Assistant** — Institute on the Biology of Aging and Metabolism, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities  
  **Oct 2020 – Jan 2022 | Minneapolis, USA**  
  *Advisor: Prof. Paul Robbins; Co-mentor: Prof. Lei Justan Zhang*  
  * Contributed to projects investigating DNA repair, gene expression, and enzyme activity in aging-related pathways.  
  * Participated in studies involving non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), PCR-based gene expression analysis, and SIRT6 activity assays.  
  * Supported experimental design, sample preparation, and data interpretation across multiple molecular biology assays.  

* **Research Assistant** — Johns Hopkins University, Department of Chemistry  
  **Aug 2022 – present | Baltimore, MD, USA**  
  *Advisor: Prof. Rigoberto Hernandez*  
  * Conduct research in molecular dynamics and computational nanoscience, with a focus on nanoscale vesicles and nanoparticle–protein interactions.  
  * Develop and analyze all-atom, coarse-grained (MARTINI), and DPD models to study structural and dynamical behavior in soft-matter systems.  
  * Investigate binding mechanisms between MPA-coated gold nanoparticles and small proteins, and evaluate structural responses using long-timescale simulations.
