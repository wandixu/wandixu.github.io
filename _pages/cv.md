## Research Experience

* **Research Assistant** — Institute on the Biology of Aging and Metabolism, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities  
  **Oct 2020 – Jan 2022 | Minneapolis, USA**  
  *Advisor: Prof. Paul Robbins; Co-mentor: Prof. Lei Justan Zhang*  

  **Project One: Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) Assay**  
  * Maintained and prepared mammalian cell cultures for NHEJ studies, including passage, counting, and transfection.  
  * Assisted in drug-treatment experiments and documented repair-related cellular responses.  

  **Project Two: PCR-based Gene Expression Analysis**  
  * Extracted RNA from multiple mouse tissues and synthesized cDNA for downstream PCR measurements.  
  * Prepared primer sets, ran PCR reactions, and compared gene-expression levels across conditions.  
  * Interpreted amplification curves and evaluated expression changes relevant to aging-related pathways.  

  **Project Three: Self-mono-ADP-ribosylation Assay**  
  * Optimized reagent concentrations and assay conditions for SIRT6 activity measurements.  
  * Performed gel electrophoresis and analyzed band intensity and protein activity using ImageJ.  


* **Research Assistant** — Johns Hopkins University, Department of Chemistry  
  **Aug 2022 – present | Baltimore, MD, USA**  
  *Advisor: Prof. Rigoberto Hernandez*  

  **Project One: Structural and Dynamical Consistency in Lipid Vesicles across All-Atom, MARTINI, and DPD Models**  
  * Constructed and equilibrated lipid vesicles at multiple resolutions, including a 12 nm all-atom vesicle and coarse-grained vesicles (12–60 nm).  
  * Evaluated model transferability using bilayer thickness, tail end-to-end distances, and radial/density distributions.  
  * Analyzed dynamical behavior through Van Hove functions, diffusion metrics, and scattering-based approaches.  

  **Project Two: Binding Interactions between MPA-Coated Gold Nanoparticles and Proteins**  
  * Performed all-atom MD simulations of nanoparticle–protein systems, including cytochrome c, aprotinin, and ubiquitin.  
  * Identified preferred binding orientations, key charged residues, and dominant interaction motifs.  
  * Quantified protein structural responses through RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary-structure analysis over 100–200 ns trajectories.
